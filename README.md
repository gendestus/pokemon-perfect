# Pokemon Perfect
This is the version of pokemon I wanted to play as a kid. I'm making this for myself with no eye towards other people's tastes.

# Features
- All pokemon up until Gen V available in Kanto
- Wild pokemon are unevolved showing the real need for the trainer
- All trainers have full teams built from a class list
- All encounters are leveled higher to make more of a challenge
- Pokemon are distributed logically based on environment and climate as well as species preference. For example, Pidgeys prefer the forests of the West while Starlys like the Urban areas in the center
- New Areas to accomodate the new pokes
    - Haunted City - the old east side of Lavender Town full of restless spirits
    - Abandoned Steel Mill - the once thriving industrial center of the Haunted City where steel types congregate
    - Daphne's Forest - a mystical forest off of route 22 housing some of the stronger forest types
    - The Badlands - a rough patch of curious desert surrounded by mountains south of Route 11
- All of the pokemon emerald expansion features
